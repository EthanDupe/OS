# Web OS

Welcome to **Web OS**, a fully functional, interactive operating system built in the browser! This project is a personal endeavor to showcase a virtual operating system experience directly in the web browser. It is part of my portfolio, which you can find [here](https://ethananaya.github.io).

## Introduction

Web OS is a fun and functional virtual operating system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to replicate the look and feel of a desktop operating system, with apps, windows, and interactive elements. It showcases several simple applications such as a file explorer, a notes app, and a browser simulation, among others. The entire system runs within a single webpage, making it lightweight and easy to try out directly in your browser.

## Features

- **Multi-app support**: Open multiple apps (Notes, Calculator, Web Browser, etc.) within resizable windows.
- **File Explorer**: A basic file system that lets you navigate and open text files.
- **Interactive apps**: Each app can be opened, minimized, resized, and closed, just like a real desktop OS.
- **Customizable themes**: Switch between light and dark themes to personalize your experience.
- **Portfolio Integration**: The OS includes a section that links to my personal portfolio for more information on my projects.

## Usage

To try out Web OS, simply visit the live demo here:

**[Web OS Demo](https://ethandupe.github.io/OS/)**

Once the Web OS is loaded in your browser:

- **Open Apps**: Click on the app icons on the desktop to open them.
- **Resize Windows**: Click and drag the corners of each window to resize.
- **Drag and Drop**: You can move windows around the screen by clicking on the window title bar.
- **Close Windows**: Click the "X" button in the top right of any window to close it.
- **Portfolio**: Navigate to the "Portfolio" app to view my work, including projects and personal achievements.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structuring the layout and elements of the OS.
- **CSS**: Styling the desktop, windows, apps, and interactive components.
- **JavaScript**: Managing the interactivity, including window movements, opening/closing apps, and managing file systems.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting the live demo of Web OS.
